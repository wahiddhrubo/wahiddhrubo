## 🧠 About Me

I'm a passionate developer and researcher working at the intersection of **web technologies** and **artificial intelligence**. My journey began with traditional machine learning and evolved into deep learning systems, and now I'm building intelligent, autonomous **AI-powered agentic applications** using **LangGraph** and **LangChain**.

Whether it’s crafting responsive full-stack applications or developing smart systems powered by ML, I enjoy building tools that are both **intuitive and intelligent**.
